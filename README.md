# generator-drupal-module

This is a small Yeoman generator to create a Drupal module.

For now it creates .info-file, .module-file and .install-file with a couple of hooks that
are pretty common.

## Generated file structure:

    Modulefolder
      |- modulename.info
      |- modulename.install
      |- modulename.module
      |- templates

## Planned:

1. Add dependencies
2. More hooks
3. Other useful stuff? (know of something you think others also could benefit from? create an issue)
